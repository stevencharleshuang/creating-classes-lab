## Introduction

> **Instructor Note**: This is a pair-programming activity.

In this lab, you'll apply your knowledge of classes to build a Java program that utilizes an `Animal` class, complete with properties, getters, and setters. After completing the class, you'll instantiate your `Animal` object and use getters and setters to display its properties.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an `Animal` class with the following `private` properties: `numLegs`, `topSpeed`, `isEndangered`, and `name`.
- Complete the constructor for the `Animal` class.
- Create all getters and setters for the `Animal` properties.
- Instantiate an `Animal` object and display some of its properties.
- Use the setter methods to modify some of the animal's properties and show the modified animal.

**Bonus**: Include additional methods in your `Animal` class that return a formatted `String` using the class properties.

#### Starter Code

You'll need to complete the constructor, getters, and setters in the provided `Animal.java` file. `Main.java` contains comments guiding you on the code you need to write.

#### Deliverable

Your program should return the text below, following the requirements above:

```
The Elephant has a top speed of 25 mph.
The Lion has a top speed of 50 mph.
```

#### Test Your Code

* Test if your text views contain the proper text.
* Test if your `Animal` constructor works correctly with proper parameters.
* Test your `Animal` class getters.
* Test your `Animal` class setters.
